            “<strong>VALUEONSITE</strong>” is a revolutionary software product designed to model a “best overall value”
            sales transaction in a market place characterized by rising interest rates and inflation. The result is in
            total contrast to Oscar Wilde's well known quip that “there are those who know the price of everything and
            the value of nothing”.

            Analysis Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            Based on a transformative evaluation methodology and proprietary algorithms we take data input by the user
            to compare competing products or services. To provide maximum utility we have structured the product to
            address the transactional needs of both buyers and sellers as they participate in the market place. While
            there are notional differences between the two the fact is that in the final analysis they can be fairly
            described as two sides of the same coin.
        </p>
        <p>
            A buyer can engage in market research analysis necessary to arrive at an optimized purchase decision or
            confirm that a decision ostensibly already made is the right choice.. Conversely the seller can apply
            the same process to determine how their product or service stacks up against their competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever the case the user is able to employ objective criteria to make an informed decision as opposed
            to relying on guess work or unreliable subjective assumptions. In mathematical terms our product can be
            described as utilizing a weighted decision matrix which may sound complicated but from a practical
            standpoint it is as simple as 1,2,3.

            What you get
        </h2>
        <p>
            In an environment cluttered with sophisticated marketing strategies that are often confusing and In some
            cases misleading "VALUEONSITE” PROVIDES CLEAR, CONCISE AND COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON ANALYSIS RESULTS. Lists
            Prices are compared to software generated Value Prices as defined by weighted price and product rating
            metrics. Differences are immediately apparent and are further amplified by the calculation of a product or
            service score.

            But why stop there?
        </h2>
        <p>
            There will be occasions where the user may still prefer an item whose List Price is greater than the Value
            Price (VP) calculated by “VALUEONSITE”. Accordingly, our product conducts the sensitivity analysis that
            identifies the changes required to price weighting or product rating to make both Value and List Price
            equal. Given that “VALUEONSITE” is a modeling exercise and therefore indicative in nature, variances to some
            degree can be expected and the user can judge whether or not they are reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
            To further exploit the capabilities of our product the user will have the ability to conduct an abbreviated
            analysis of a transaction decision ostensibly already made. Typically this will occur for those items that
            are of low dollar value and as such may not warrant intensive scrutiny in terms of decision making.
            Notwithstanding, the ability to do what amounts to a quick price check will provide a level of comfort for
            the user in terms of dispensing with any lingering doubts a buyer may experience after a transaction is
            concluded.

            Setting aside the benefits that accrue from being able to make an informed decision, use of our product will
            translate into the peace of mind for the user as a result of:

                    Being excited at the prospect of knowing you have made a wise
