              Welcome to the introduction and demonstration of "VALUEWAND", a revolutionary software product designed to 
              identify the product/service that provides the "best overall value" among competing options. The process is 
              based on the use of an easily understood decision matrix table requiring minimal user inputs. The net result 
              is in total contrast to Oscar Wilde's well known quip <strong>"that there are those who know the price of everything
              and the value of nothing".</strong>

            <p>
              Despite the notional differences between buyers and sellers, they can be fairly described as two sides 
              of the same coin. They both intuitively assess the quality and associated price of a product/service that 
              will maximize the benefits that accrue to them. While subjective in nature this process is not without merit. 
              We employ the same evaluation criteria with our proprietary algorithms and methodologies to produce objective 
              and measurable outcomes. This transactional analysis allows buyers and sellers to participate with confidence 
              in a market place characterized by rising interest rates and inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
              To put it succinctly if there ever was a product for our times this is it. Buyer's remorse will be profoundly 
              mitigated through market analysis, or, by corroborating a purchase decision ostensibly already made. Sellers 
              on the other hand can discern price points that satisfy competitive requirements. Moreover, all parties involved will 
              enjoy the peace of mind that comes from engaging in a disciplined and objective analysis process that will enhance 
              their ability to make informed decisions.

            </h2>
            <p>
              The ability to make smart money decisions is a key component of financial literacy. Our product is fundamental to 
              achieving this goal. It is our intention to award an exclusive perpetual software license to an organization that 
              can make this product widely available On the surface at least financial institutions are obvious candidates. 
              However, our current focus is on select fintech companies who may view our product as being complimentary to 
              existing product portfolios. Should that be the case we look forward to your response.

              To further amplify our assertion we have available an <a href="demo.html">interactive demo</a> which we invite you to access.

              There will be occasions where the user may still prefer an item whose List Price is greater than the Value
              Price (VP) calculated by <strong>"VALUEONSITE"</strong>. Accordingly, our product conducts the sensitivity
              analysis that
              identifies the changes required to price weighting or product rating to make both Value and List Price
              equal. Given that <strong>"VALUEONSITE"</strong> is a modeling exercise and therefore indicative in nature,
              variances to some
              degree can be expected and the user can judge whether or not they are reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
              To further exploit the capabilities of our product the user will have the ability to conduct an abbreviated
              analysis of a transaction decision ostensibly already made. Typically this will occur for those items that
              are of low dollar value and as such may not warrant intensive scrutiny in terms of decision making.
              Notwithstanding, the ability to do what amounts to a quick price check will provide a level of comfort for
              the user in terms of dispensing with any lingering doubts a buyer may experience after a transaction is
              concluded.
